/**
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
 * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them
 * is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if
 * two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 * <p>
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
 * determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 * Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
