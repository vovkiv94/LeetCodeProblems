/**
 * Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
 * <p>
 * Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
 * Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
 * Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8
 * (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
 * From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5].
 * There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
